					<li><h4>Jessica D. Omandac</h4></li>
					<li>Hi! I'm Jessica and most of my friends call me sikang.
I'm 19 yrs old and was born on the 21st of September. 
I like to read a lot when I have a tons of free time. 
I used to play volleyball when I was in my highschool years. 
I used to work as well in a BPO industry for almost a year. 
I guess working earlier than everyone around my age made me a bit tougher and 
think bit different from their perspective in life. I am the 4th born in our family 
and the eldest girl which is a bit 
pressuring since I have two younger sister who look up to me as their ate.
 My goal in life to give my parents a life that they deserve not a very fancy one
 but a life wherein they don't need to worry about anything.</li>

					<li><h4>Sean Andrie Ravanes</h4></li>
					<li>I am Sean Andrei Ravanes, eldest son in the family.
					I grew up loving sports since my parents are busy making living. 
					I've been actively participating in our barangay's activities and events, to cut it short-- 
					I am a socially active individual. 
					I love having fun and molding myself through outdoor activities. 
					You may see me as an irresponsible person due to my actions sometimes, 
					but I am the other way around.</li>
